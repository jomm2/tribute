                Thors Snorresson (トールズ・スノーレソン Tōruzu Sunōreson) 
                was a Jomsviking commander whose phenomenal combat skills 
                earned him the moniker "Troll of Jom". He fought for years 
                as a fierce warrior, up until the birth of his daughter. He 
                began to grow tired and decided to surrender his warrior lifestyle,
                 fake his death and settle down in Iceland.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Thors was the strongest, bravest, and most well-known warrior
                 throughout the Viking World. He was the only man who could beat
                  Thorkell the Tall in single combat. He used to be a Jomsviking 
                  and through only strength of arms and ability in combat he got 
                  the rank of captain when he was still 25 years old. Sigvaldi,
                   the commander of the Jomsvikings, Sigvaldi, liked him so much 
                   that he agreed for Thors to marry his daughter, Helga.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                He was the son of Snorre and the father of Thorfinn and Ylva. 
                Through his marriage to Helga, Thors was the son-in-law of
                Sigvaldi, the Jomsvikings' third Cheif, and was the nephew-in-law 
                of Thorkell.
